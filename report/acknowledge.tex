First and foremost, I'd like to thank both my project supervisor, Dr Karim Djemame, and my project Assessor, Dr Mark Walkley, for support and feedback throughout the project. For support with the Cloud Testbed, I'd like to thank Dr Django Armstrong.

I'd also like to thank my friends, for their advice at various points, and my girlfriend for a never-ending supply of patience.
