% No ethical issues arose during my project.
Ethical issues may occur depending on the data used for the experiments. A variety of different datasets are available which could be used for the `real-world' experiment. Data may contain personally identifiable information, or have other ethical concerns. 

It can be assumed that any dataset used will be publicly available, and will be suitably anonymised with suitable stakeholders having been consulted. For example, the 1000 Genomes project will contain the genome information of a large number of people. It can be assumed that those people have agreed to make their genome data available for research purposes.

There may be no ethical concerns, depending on the dataset selected.
