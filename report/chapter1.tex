\section{Project Aim}
Large scale data processing is an emerging trend in Computing, with benefits to both academia and industry. The aim of this project is to investigate the challenges of large scale parallel data processing, discuss the benefits of Cloud Computing and investigate how the efficiency of large scale data processing may be improved. 

This project will aim to provide a reasoned and objective evaluation of the efficiency of data processing techniques, whilst comparing current state of the art tools and technologies with newer research in the field. 

Specifically, the data processing tools Hadoop and Nephele will be compared, allowing comparison of the individual tools, and a wider discussion of the pros and cons of the MapReduce and PACT programming paradigms. 

The project aims to answer the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Does PACT overcome the inherent disadvantages of the MapReduce paradigm?
	\item How well does Nephele perform MapReduce tasks?
	\item How do Hadoop and Nephele perform in a highly elastic Cloud Computing environment?
\end{itemize}  

\section{Objectives}
The objectives of the project are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Background Research
	The background research will provide context for the project through a summary of Cloud Computing, Big Data, and any other relevant trends. It will discuss current tools and technologies in use for large scale data processing, and identify research which aims to overcome the key deficiencies in existing approaches.

	\item Experiment Design
	Experiments will be designed to test the efficiency of tools in relevant situations. This will require identifying relevant areas of interest, and deriving scenarios which will test the efficiency of tools. The experiments should be designed to take into account the various different problems that data processing tools are required to solve. There should also be experiments to test the tools in different environments, in order to evaluate how well they perform in Cloud environments. 

	As part of the experiment design, a hypothesis will be produced.

	\item Experiment Implementation
	The experiments will be implemented and executed, in order to gather results which indicate the efficiency of tools in different environments and situations.

	\item Experiment Evaluation
	The evaluation will compare the efficiency of Hadoop and Nephele using the data obtained in the experiments. It will consider the results and how they are related to existing research (obtained in the background research). It will also discuss how the results compare with the hypothesis and consider the causes of discrepancies (should any exist). 

	\item Project Evaluation
	The project will be considered as a whole, with a considered evaluation of several aspects. It should consider the relevance of the project in regards to existing literature, how it contributes to the research landscape and whether there is a place for future research in to this area. The project should also be evaluated on whether it has met the aims and objectives.
