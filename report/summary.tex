In recent years large scale parallel data processing has emerged as an important application for both academia and industry. Hadoop is currently the de-facto tool for processing these large amounts of data, implementing the MapReduce paradigm to provide efficient distribution of data processing. However, the MapReduce paradigm may be inadequate for representing some large scale data processing tasks in an efficient manner.

In this project we investigate alternative data processing tools to determine whether they can address the shortcomings in the MapReduce paradigm, and consider their capabilities when used in a Cloud Computing environment. This is achieved by providing a comprehensive performance evaluation of one such alternative tool (Stratosphere) in comparison to Hadoop.

Our experiment results show that Stratosphere outperforms Hadoop in both iterative scenarios, and those typically considered better suited to the MapReduce paradigm.
